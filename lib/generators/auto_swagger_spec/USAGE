Description:
    Creates a swagger spec file automatically.
    Needs a standard configured Api Controller with Serializer(s) that have a Schema defined.
    `MODEL_BASE` constant with the main resource model needs to be defined on the Controller.
    The internal logic will automatically figure out required params for the URL.

Example:
    bin/rails generate auto_swagger_spec v1_named_route

    This will create:
        spec/integration/v1/named_route_spec.rb
