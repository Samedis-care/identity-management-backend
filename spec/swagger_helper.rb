        description: '# Obtaining a Bearer token

To obtain a Bearer authentication token for your users you need to redirect them to the Identity Management login page: `https://ident.services/login/{APP_NAME}`. The site takes the following optional query parameters:
- `redirect_host`: The target redirection URL (e.g. `https://my-app/user/visited/this/without/session`). The target hostname is validated against a whitelist. If the supplied hostname is not on the whitelist the user is redirected to the domain linked with your application.

After the user logged in he is redirected to `/authenticated` on your site. The following parameters are passed as anchor (accessible via `window.location.hash` in your frontend):
- `token` (string): The user Bearer token
- `token_expire` (Unix Timestamp in milliseconds) The expire date of the token
- `refresh_token` (string): Token to obtain a new Bearer token
- `remember_me` (boolean): Has the user checked remember me? If true you should persist the `token`, `token_expire` and `refresh_token`, otherwise you should store them as client side cookies to remove them as the user closes his browser.
- `redirect_path` (string, may be empty): Pathname of the URL passed to the login site as `redirect_host` (e.g. `/user/visited/this/without/session`)
- `invite_token` (string, may be empty): User invitation token (if login comes from an invite email)

# Refreshing the Bearer token

To refresh the Bearer token using a `refresh_token` please refer to the API documentation for the following endpoint `/api/v1/{APP_NAME}/oauth/token`'
